# 🌍🛰️ Planet: Understanding the Amazon from Space 🛰(computer vision)(classification)
## Use satellite data to track the human footprint in the Amazon rainforest

### Description
🌍🛰️ Planet Aerial Imagery

Every passing minute, an expanse of forest equivalent to 48 football fields disappears from our planet. The Amazon Basin takes the lead in this alarming deforestation trend, contributing to biodiversity loss, habitat destruction, climate change, and other catastrophic effects. Precise data on deforestation and human activities in forests is crucial for swift and effective responses from governments and local stakeholders.

🛰️ Planet, the innovator behind the world’s largest fleet of Earth-imaging satellites, is set to capture daily imagery of the entire Earth's land surface at an impressive 3-5 meter resolution. While existing research focuses on monitoring forest changes, it often relies on coarse-resolution imagery from sources like Landsat (30-meter pixels) or MODIS (250-meter pixels), limiting its effectiveness in areas dominated by small-scale deforestation or forest degradation.

Moreover, current methods struggle to distinguish between human-induced and natural forest loss. Higher resolution imagery, such as that from Planet, has demonstrated exceptional capability in this regard, but robust algorithms are yet to be developed.

🌈 In this competition, Planet and its Brazilian partner SCCON invite Kagglers to colorfully label satellite image chips with atmospheric conditions and various classes of land cover/land use. The resulting algorithms will empower the global community to comprehensively understand when, where, and why deforestation occurs worldwide—and, most importantly, how to respond effectively. 🚀✨
